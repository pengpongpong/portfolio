                <h2>Collection, Processing, and Use of Personal Data</h2>
                <p>
                    You can visit my website without providing any personal
                    information. We only store access data in server log files,
                    such as the name of the requested file, date and time of
                    access, amount of data transmitted, and the requesting
                    provider. This data is used solely to ensure the smooth
                    operation of the site and to improve services. It does not
                    allow us to draw conclusions about your identity.

                    cookies (as mentioned in Section 2). The information
                    generated by the cookie about your use of this website,
                    including your IP address, is transmitted to a Google server

                </p>
                <p>
                    Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the
                    website, compile reports on website activity for website

                    Google may also transfer this information to third parties

                <p>
                    Google will not associate your IP address with any other

                    cookies by adjusting your browser software settings;

                <h2>Integration of Third-Party Services and Content</h2>
                <p>
                    Within our online offering, we utilize content or service
                    offerings from third-party providers due to our legitimate
                    interests (i.e., the interest in the analysis, optimization,
                    and economic operation of our online offering in accordance
                    with Article 6, Paragraph 1, letter f of the General Data
                    Protection Regulation). This is done to integrate their
                    content and services, such as videos or fonts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This requires that the third-party providers of this content
                    perceive the IP address of the users, as they could not send
                    the content to their browser without the IP address. The IP
                    address is thus necessary to display this content. We are
                    committed to using only such content whose respective
                    providers use the IP address exclusively to deliver the
                    content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel
                    tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for
                    statistical or marketing purposes. With the help of "pixel
                    tags," information such as visitor traffic to the pages of
                    this website can be evaluated. The pseudonymous information
                    can also be stored in cookies on the users' devices and may
                    include technical details about the browser and operating
                    system, referring websites, visit times, and other
                    information about the use of our online offering.
                    Additionally, they can be linked with information from other
                    sources.
